# OurStory — MapleStory Tooling

A Rust workspace for MapleStory game tooling.

## Crates

- **`wz-cli`** (`crates/wz-cli/`) — CLI tool and library for probing MapleStory `.wz` asset files. Use this to explore the WZ tree structure (maps, sprites, items, sounds, strings, etc.), search nodes by name, dump subtrees as JSON, and understand the game data taxonomy. Forms the data layer for higher-level tooling.
- **`client`** (`crates/client/`) — Bevy-based game client that renders maps and sprites from WZ assets.

## Server Crates

- **`protocol`** (`crates/protocol/`) — Shared packet definitions, opcodes, and game enums used by both client and server. No game logic.
- **`server-core`** (`crates/server-core/`) — Game logic library: map, channel, world, player state, routing. Pure logic, no I/O.
- **`server`** (`crates/server/`) — Binary that wires everything together. Accepts `--role login|world|channel|map` to run as the appropriate server type.

## Architecture

- **Channel owns TCP** — players connect to a Channel server. Map switches within a channel are in-memory (no reconnect).
- **Channel switch = TCP reconnect** — player disconnects from one channel port and reconnects to another. Buffs are preserved in-memory via World; everything else reloaded from DB.
- **MapHandle trait** — maps run in-process by default (`LocalMapHandle`). For high-population content (boss fights), a `RemoteMapHandle` impl forwards to a standalone map process.
- **Deployment** — one binary, four roles. Dev uses `--role channel` with all layers in-process. Prod can split Login, World, Channel(s), and standalone Map instances as needed.

## Coordinate System

WZ stores 2D pixel coordinates with Y increasing downward; Bevy uses Y-up.
All WZ\u2192Bevy conversion happens at the `crates/client/src/wz/` boundary:

- `TryFrom<Node> for Vec2` reads WZ `Vector2D` values and negates Y.
- `Node::read_pos()` reads scalar `x`/`y` children and negates Y.
- `Node::read_pos_n(n)` reads `x{n}`/`y{n}` (footholds, areas) and negates Y.

Downstream consumers (`map`, `mob`, `character`, all `WzMapAsset` / `WzMobAsset`
fields, all `Transform`s, all events) treat coordinates as native Bevy-space.
The conversion formula `bevy_y = -wz_y` is applied exactly once per value,
inside the `wz` module. There are no Y-negations or origin-flip sign games
in any runtime system.

**Origins** are loaded as Bevy-local pixel offsets (already Y-flipped). With
`Anchor::TOP_LEFT`, the formula `bevy_translation = pos - origin` places the
sprite's WZ pivot at the desired Bevy world position.

**Non-coordinate scalars** (`alpha`, `rx`, `ry`, `mag`, `delay`, `cy`,
`mobTime`, `force`, `piece`, `cx`, layer indices) are read as raw `i32`/`f32`
and untouched by the conversion.

**Footholds:** `Foothold.{x1,y1,x2,y2}` are Bevy-space. `layer_at()` uses
the inequality `f.y_at(x) >= y - 50.0` (foothold at or below entity, where
"below" means smaller Bevy Y).

**Network boundary** (future): `protocol::types::Position` uses WZ-Y
convention for wire compatibility with classic clients. Any code that
consumes inbound positions or emits outbound positions must negate Y at the
network handler. The server stores `Position` opaquely; it has no Y-direction
logic today.

## Client — Character Rendering (`crates/client/src/character/`)

The character module composites MapleStory character sprites (body, head, hair, face, equipment) with animation and correct z-ordering.

### Key components

- **Z-ordering** — `Base.wz/zmap.img` defines 151 z-layer names in file order. Lower zmap index = front (higher Bevy z). `ZMap::depth()` inverts the index: `bevy_z = (150 - index) + 50`, giving a z-range of 50–200 (above map tiles at z=0–2). `load_zmap()` uses `WzImage::resolve_children()` for deterministic file-order iteration (WZ reader stores children in a HashMap).
- **Hierarchical positioning** — `compute_frame_transforms()` positions parts via connection points from each part's `map` subnode (navel, neck, brow, hand, earOverHead, earBelowHead). Parts with `navel` attach to root center; others match by connection-point name to already-positioned parts.
- **Animation** — Body actions (stand1, walk1, jump, etc.) and face expressions (default, blink, etc.) animate independently via separate timers. Face expressions merge into the body frame's part list before transform computation.
- **Preloading** — All action frames for a body skin are preloaded at spawn. No lazy loading.
- **Keyboard controls** (dev testing) — `1` stand1, `2` walk1, `3` jump, `4` sit, `5` prone, `6` ladder, `7` rope, `8` fly, `9` alert, `0` dead, `Q` swingO1, `W` swingP1, `E` shoot1, `R` magic1.
